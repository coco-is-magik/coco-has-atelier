                    This website is a perpetual work in progress, acting as a sort of presentation medium for my various projects.
                    Though I work with computers, I consider myself a computer person second and a person absent any additional descriptor first.
                    I hope you find your visit enjoyable, and my work interesting. Please leave a comment on the bottom right of the page, I
                    promise to read them all!

                        Currently, there isn't really anything of note on the website. You are on the main page already, and a few sites
                        are linked under Realms Worth Travelling To (both forums which I frequent). There is also a comment box which connects
                        to a google form/sheet, though I haven't gotten around to fixing the caching issue, so you'll need to wait a few minutes
                        to see your comment appear.

                        I have a number of different planned features. Playing around with front end development a bit more, I intend to add
                        musical ambience, a pause to the javascript that moves the boxes around, and create a matrix-like effect of falling
                        characters. Past that, my first major project will be to start working on Wet Sock Esoterica, and I already have a few
                        major things I would like to start writing about there. Stewardship Automata is also of short term interest, since I am
                        currently (Aug. 17 2024) at a point in nmy life where a finnancial planning and simulation tool would be useful. Other
                        long term projects, such as getting a working emulator embedded in a static site with web assembly, a function forum
                        for users to post in, and a cybersecurity news feed are all also on my mind.

                        Ours is a world in decline. Across the globe, there is hardship which is both avoidable and unecessary. Wether its academics,
                        scientific advancement, general literacy, philosopy, economics, politics and the machinery of government, and so on the
                        concern is the same; Where we are now is not as good as where we once were. It's an uncomfortable thought, and I can already
                        hear the arguments and dismissal of those who cannot suffer it. Some say, "but the economy is getting bigger", and some say,
                        "but our technology and medicine are more advanced", and they are not wrong, but I think they are missing the point. I will
                        explain.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Though it is true, children in much of the world no longer have anything to fear from polio, and the economy tends upwards
                        over time even through hardship and downturns, that does not mean we have not regressed from our peak. The economy grows,
                        but the middle class shrinks; It becomes harder and harder for the average person to even find a job, much less buy a home,
                        and increasingly it is the case that more than two incomes are necessary to sustain a household where previously one was
                        enough. Medicine is more advanced, and yet we have more problems with healthcare than ever before; More crisis, more
                        shortages of qualified staff, more people refusing to go to get even basic care. A lot of that is to do  with the cost, 
                        but it is also a fact that the food that we eat and the things that we do are having a profound impact on our health. We have
                        higher rates of education than ever before, and yet the rate of literacy seems to be dropping like a brick, and people seem
                        to know so little it is almost cause for doubt if they actually ever even showed up to school in the first place. Our
                        understanding of the universe has advanced, and yet technological progress has slowed and breakthroughs have all but halted.
                        The pattern continues on and on.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        The circumstances in which we find ourselves, and adrift beyond the safe harbor which our predecessors were supposed to provide,
                        require that people need to rise to the challenge thrust upon us. When things are tough, we need to roll up our sleeves and get to
                        work on our own small corner of the world; Even though it is not fair, it is not easy, and it feels near impossible, I feel compelled
                        to roll up my sleeves and get to work anyway. Maybe I won't ever get to see the fruits of my labor, maybe I will instead live to see
                        it all destroyed again and again, but I will never stop trying to make something better, something new, something worth toiling for.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I think things are bad, and I think they are gonna get worse. I hope I am wrong, but I don't think I am, and it worries me. But despite
                        the dire nature of my beliefs, I still have hope. I still smile. I still believe that one day, some day, things will improve. That
                        humanity will survive to look back on these times, and hopefully even learn from them. In the meantime, I will keep working on my little
                        corner of the world. I hope you enjoy the parts I choose to share with you here in my atelier. Thank you for reading!
